# customer-satisfaction-score-prediction# Customer Satisfaction Score Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict customer satisfaction scores based on various factors such as product quality, service quality, purchase frequency, and feedback. It utilizes machine learning techniques to build a predictive model that can help businesses understand and improve customer satisfaction.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about customer demographics, purchase history, and feedback. It includes features such as:

- Age
- Gender
- Country
- Income
- Product Quality
- Service Quality
- Purchase Frequency
- Feedback Score
- Loyalty Level
- Satisfaction Score (Target Variable)

**Source:** [Mention the source of your dataset, e.g., Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository]

## Methodology

The following steps were followed in this project:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
   - Loading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
   - Handling missing values (if any).
   - Converting categorical features into numerical representations using one-hot encoding or label encoding.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Analyzing the distribution of features.
   - Identifying relationships between features and the target variable.
   - Visualizing data using plots and charts.

3. **Model Selection:**
   - Evaluating various regression models such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, Support Vector Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors Regression.
   - Selecting the most promising models based on initial performance.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Optimizing the hyperparameters of the selected models using techniques like Grid Search, Random Search, or Bayesian Optimization.
   - Fine-tuning the models to achieve the best possible performance.

5. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluating the tuned models on a held-out test set using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R2).
   - Comparing the performance of different models and selecting the best-performing one.
